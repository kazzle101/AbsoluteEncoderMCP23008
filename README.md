# Absolute Encoder MCP23008
Using an MCP23008 i2c GPIO chip to read an Absolute Contacting Encoder with a Teensy 3.2

A development of my Absolute Encoder Demo https://github.com/kazzle101/AbsoluteEncoderDemo but this one has been simplified and has logic for the encoder only, I have also put this into a class. This software has been written using VS Code rather than the Ardunio IDE.

The class can be found in lib/src/ACE_Encoder
Demo for use is in src/main.cpp
